BrandSync is an Asset Generation and Brand Management application, making it easy for organizations to manage their branding across the digital and physical world. Working in the marketing and print industry as a software engineer opened my eyes to the messy workflows involved in printing and marketing. I made BrandSync to provide organizations with a centralized, dynamic, and version-controlled branding platform. Updates reflect across the entire system – business cards, invoices, websites, envelopes, etc. are dynamically updated when branding is updated. Need to update a logo, but worried about marketing and branding drift? Our platform solves that. An employee no longer works with you? Our platform can reflect that change across all your print and marketing materials. Need to send 10,000 promotional envelopes? Our platform shines.
